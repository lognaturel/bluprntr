BluPrntr
========

A Chrome extension (and local server) to save your Bluprint classes while you watch!

Requirements
------------

Ensure both **Node** and **npm** (or yarn) are installed and their installation location in your system path.

#### Windows

Use the Windows installers from the Node.js [website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

_-or-_

Install `node` and `npm`/`yarn` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)**\***:

```powershell
choco install nodejs

# Optionally install yarn.
choco install yarn
```

**\*** `choco` is the preferred method.

#### Linux

Install `node` and `npm`/`yarn` using a package manager or comparable method.

Instructions
------------

Run `yarn` or `npm` to install the node dependencies and start the server.

```bash
# Install the dependencies (only needed once),
yarn install

# and start the server.
yarn start

# Instead of yarn, npm can be used.
npm install
npm start
```

Now as you browse Bluprnt classes, the videos you watch will be downloaded to your home directory or what has been set with `BLUPRNTR_DOWNLOAD_PATH`.

### Set Download Path

The environment variable `BLUPRNTR_DOWNLOAD_PATH` will be used as the download location.
A `.env` file can also be used.

### Detailed Instructions for Downloading Classes

The following steps will download a class video to disk.

1. Install the Chrome Extension (instructions in next section).
2. Start the Server (`yarn start`).
3. Navigate to a class in Chrome.
4. Open Chrome's _Developer Tools_ and select the network tab.
5. Click a class video.
6. Watch the output in the server that was started.
